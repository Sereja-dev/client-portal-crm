/**
 * Sale-Ready Phase E, E3.4. Not a static/grep check like every other file
 * in this directory — a real, end-to-end smoke test of the integration
 * test runner's own exit-code propagation, added after discovering that
 * `npm run test:integration` (and even a bare `vitest run --config
 * vitest.integration.config.mts`) reported failing tests but still exited
 * 0, which meant GitHub CI's "integration" check could never actually fail
 * from a real integration-test regression (see this stage's own report for
 * the full root cause: `@electric-sql/pglite`'s WASM Postgres engine calls
 * Emscripten's `quit_` shim on `.close()`, which does a bare
 * `process.exitCode = status` — clobbering whatever exit code Vitest had
 * already set, regardless of test outcome). `test/support/local-
 * postgres.ts`'s `stopTestDatabase()` now saves/restores `process.exitCode`
 * around that shutdown sequence specifically to prevent this — this check
 * exists so a future change to that fix, to `@electric-sql/pglite`'s own
 * behavior, or to `vitest.integration.config.mts` can never silently regress
 * back to a CI setup that accepts arbitrary integration failures as green.
 *
 * Writes one throwaway, deliberately-failing spec file inside
 * `test/integration/` (Vitest's own `include` glob requires it to live
 * there to be picked up at all), runs the real integration config against
 * only that one file, and asserts the child process exits non-zero. Always
 * deletes the throwaway file in a `finally`, so a crash mid-check never
 * leaves it behind for the real suite to pick up.
